# Numerical stochastic methods algorithms

This repository contains implemented (and documented) algorithms from a introductory numerical stochastic methods university course.

GNU Octave is required to run the code, along with the statistics package from octave-forge. Most files have unit tests, you can run them from the command line using `octave tests.m`.
